# The IDGAF License (v1.0a-draft-final-actual-final1..2..zeta-rewrite)

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain, because
seriously, who has time for complicated licenses?

## The Important Bits:
- ✅ Use it
- ✅ Copy it
- ✅ Modify it
- ✅ Sell it
- ✅ Deploy it
- ✅ Stretch it
- ✅ Bop it
- ✅ Roll it down stairs
- ✅ Alone or in pairs
- ✅ Whatever else you can think of

## The Legal-ish Part:

In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author of this software
dedicates any and all copyright interest in the software to the public domain.
We make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the
detriment of our heirs and successors (who probably wouldn't know what to do
with it anyway).

## The Reality Check:

This software is provided "as is", because YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary). If it
breaks, you get to keep both pieces! No warranty, no guarantees, no
responsibility. But, if it helps, it does work perfectly in my environment.

## The Bottom Line:

Do whatever you want with this. Seriously. Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it.
Turn it into a modern art installation. We're not your parents.

## The Final Word:

If you really need me to care about what you do with this code, please submit
your request via interpretive dance, recorded on a potato, and sent via
[carrier pigeon](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549).

Remember: Life's too short for restrictive licenses. Go build something cool.

engineering excellence. Side effects may include sudden urges to refactor
everything. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.)_
